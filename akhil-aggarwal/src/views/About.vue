              <p style="color: black">I have recently given my board exams â€“ Grade 12, Ryan International School, Amritsar. I have perused Diploma in Graphic Designing, Website Designing, Video Editing and Composting from Oxl School of Multimedia. Currently I am perusing Diploma in 3D Animation. In 3d Animation I have completed my modeling part and I am currently working on texturing, sculpturing and Rigging Part -Specializing in Character Animation. I am also learning new Web Technologies by attending boot camps of Google Developer Group and Webinars. I started all this stuff when I was in Grade 6. In Grade 6 I went for a pre-journalism course there we taught different modules I got interested in the Editing one. After that my father helped me in joining an Editing Institute in my city - Amritsar. Then I started working on different software and learning different things each day. Somehow I faced some problems with my studies but all my teachers, friends and my family supported me during my failures. Now I am also working as a freelancer. Some of my projects include Corporate Filming for Clarissa Resorts situated in Jim Corbett National Park, Graphic and Web Designing for Bansal Nuts and Web Designing for NOFD Bakery and Fine Art Studio.
I also like participating in different competitions and programs like Google Code-In, Google Summer of Code and different designing competition.
<br>I am specially thankful to my father who was always there to support me and my mother who always motivated me during my failures.
