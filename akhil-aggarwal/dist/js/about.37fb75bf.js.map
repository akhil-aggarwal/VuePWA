In 3d Animation I have completed my modeling part and I am currently working on texturing, sculpturing and Rigging Part -Specializing in Character Animation. I am also learning new Web Technologies by attending boot camps of Google Developer Group and Webinars. I started all this stuff when I was in Grade 6. In Grade 6 I went for a pre-journalism course there we taught different modules I got interested in the Editing one. After that my father helped me in joining an Editing Institute in my city - Amritsar. Then I started working on different software and learning different things each day. Somehow I faced some problems with my studies but all my teachers, friends and my family supported me during my failures. Now I am also working as a freelancer.
